This may be overkill to have as it's own repo but I will be putting Resource material in here. 

I'm assuming that if I have time, I will chop up and rework this information- but for now I'm most likely going to put in a link with a short summary of why I want to use it for reference or just to learn in general.

The differen't types of resources will be labeled respectively in their very own cute little text files.

I don't even know if all of these will be program related, I do dabble in many things.
